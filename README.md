# Uni-Projects

This repository contains various code projects developed for the BSc Physics degree at UNIPD. Each folder addresses a different topic or experiment in computational physics, electronics, or data analysis. Below is an overview of the main contents:

## Physics_lab
Scripts and documentation for laboratory experiments:
- `LabH.py`: Helper functions for lab data analysis(used also in other programs).
- `Lab-1/`, `Lab-2/`, `Lab-3/`: Data and code for specific lab sessions (e.g., operational amplifiers, RC circuits, diodes ...).
- `Usefull_documentation/`: Manuals, datasheets, and notes for lab equipment and procedures.

## Computational_methods
Projects related to computational physics methods, especially orbital mechanics:
- `Voyager2/`: Simulations and analysis of the Voyager 2 spacecraft's trajectory, including:
  - `voyager2_full_orbit.py`, `jupiter_flyby.py`, `found_TCM.py`, `get_data.py`: Scripts for orbit calculations and data processing.
  - `graphs/`: Plots of orbits, energies, and velocities.
  - `tests/`: Test scripts and example outputs (e.g., orbit GIFs).

## SF2
Analysis of RC, RLC, and related circuits:
- `RC - f/`, `RLC/`, `RLC-f/`: Data, scripts, and plots for frequency response and circuit analysis.
- Example scripts: `RCf.py`, `rlc.py`, `RLCf.py`.

## muon_detector
Code and data for muon detection experiments:
- `muon.py`: Main analysis script.
- Data files: `muon.txt`, `muon1.txt`.
- Example output: `muon_detection_vs_angleg1-3.png`.

## 3D_fluid_flux
Scripts and data for analyzing fluid flux in three dimensions. Includes:
- `flux.py`: Main script for reading data and plotting 3D flux with error bars.
- `data.txt`: Data file used by the script.
- Example output images: `3D_flux.png`, `3D_flux2.png`.

## General Notes
- Each folder contains scripts, data, and output files relevant to its topic.
- Most Python scripts require standard scientific libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, etc.).
- For details on each experiment or analysis, refer to the code comments and data files.
